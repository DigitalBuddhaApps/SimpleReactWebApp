## Setting up Gulp (optional)

You can also use Gulp to add additional build tasks. To use, follow the instructions below.

Navigate to the root directory and  run the following command:
```
> npm install
```

After modules are installed, you can start watching for SCSS changes using the command:
```

```

You can install more modules and configure them in the **gulpfile.js** file as needed.
